A collection of C++ programs that use MPI

Contains:
* gradient_descent: An implementation of Horovod by Uber for efficient training of machine learning models on clusters.
* role_call: Makes all MPI nodes print their ID to the stdout.
* redirect_input: Shows how to redirect input to a specific node.
* oddevensorting: Shows how to sort efficiently on clusters using MPI
* cannon: An implementation of Cannon's algorithm for matrix muliplication.

Relies on:
* Eigen for gradient_descent program
* MNIST data for training
